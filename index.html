  <p>From a young age I always enjoyed listening to all the great music in files like Star Wars, Disney and Harry Potter.
    Soundtracks always helped tell the stories that clicked with me on an emotional level. Over the years I began exploring the
    music for film and games more. Growing to understand and learn about all the different styles of them.
    I studied Music Composition and Technology for Film and Games at the University of Hertfordshire. I learnt about a diverse range of styles
    from Orchestral, Popular, World and Electronic music. All encompasing soundtracks for media. Everything I
    learnt here helped shaped my own style of music I enjoy creating today. At present I am the Audio Director at Watercress Studios, A visual novel studio.
    Here I have worked on 5 games towrds Original Soundtracks, Sound Design and Dialogue editing/mixing.
